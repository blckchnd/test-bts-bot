Whether its banking,\\nstock exchanges, lotteries, voting, music, auctions or many others, a digital\\npublic ledger allows for the creation of distributed autonomous companies (or\\nDACs) that provide better quality services at a fraction of the cost incurred by\\ntheir more traditional, centralized counterparts. The advent of DACs ushers in a\\nnew paradigm in organizational structure in which companies can run without any\\nhuman management and under the control of an incorruptible set of business\\nrules. These rules are encoded in publicly auditable open source software\\ndistributed across the computers of the companies’ shareholders, who\\neffortlessly secure the company from arbitrary control.</p>\\n<p>BitShares does for business what bitcoin did for money by utilizing distributed\\nconsensus technology to create companies that are inherently global,\\ntransparent, trustworthy, efficient and most importantly profitable.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"wallet\\\">Wallet</h2>\\n<p>This wallet allows access most features of the BitShares network including</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/help/assets/mpa\\\">BitAssets</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/help/assets/uia\\\">User-Issued Assets</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/help/dex/introduction\\\">The DEX</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\";","module.exports = \"<h1 id=\\\"blockchain\\\">Blockchain</h1>\\n<p>As most crypto currencies, Graphene makes use of a blockchain to update\\nparticipants about transfers and market activities.

SmartCoins have no counterparty risk, so the only risk you experience when using a bridge is during the short time it takes to complete the transfer. This is better than a centralized exchange such as Poloniex, where you are always at risk of the exchange being hacked, going bankrupt, or experiencing any number of other issues.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"gateways-trust-based-model\\\">Gateways: trust-based model</h3>\\n<p>Gateways are basically equivalent to the standard exchange model where you depend on the solvency of the exchange to be able to redeem your coins. Generally gateways issue assets prefixed with their symbol, like OPEN, TRADE, or META. These assets are backed 100% by the real BTC or ETH or any other coin that people deposit with the gateways.</p>\\n<p>An OPEN.BTC is thus in theory equivalent to the BTC you get on Poloniex, which could be prefixed POLO.BTC. In both cases you rely on the service provider, CCEDK for OPEN. assets and Poloniex for POLO. assets, to remain solvent in order to back the value of the assets they&#39;ve issued.

Маржинальная позиция будет вынуждена продавать своё залоговое обеспечение каждый раз, когда самое высокое предложение на покупку обеспечения окажется меньше, чем цена дострочного выкупа (x/BTS).</p>\\n<pre><code>SQP = расчетная цена / MSQR\\nцена дострочного выкупа = DEBT / COLLATERAL * MCR\\n</code></pre><p>При маржин колле одолженный актив будет куплен на внесенное залоговое обеспечение по рыночной цене вплоть до SQP и позиция будет закрыта.

После этого шага короткая продажа считается завершенной, и Вы закрыли короткую позицию с этим конкретным bitAsset.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">Обновление обеспечивающего залога</h2>\\n<p>В любой момент держатель заемной/шорт позиции может изменить обеспечивающий залог в стремлении гибко подстроиться под поведение рынка. Если обеспечивающий залог увеличится, в качестве залога будет заморожено дополнительное количество BTS, тогда как уменьшение обеспечивающего залога потребует выплаты соответствующего количества BitAsset обратно сети.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">Покрытие</h2>\\n<p>Чтобы закрыть заемную/шорт позицию нужно обладать одолженным количеством этого конкретного bitAsset, дабы передать его сети BitShares.

BitShares создан для того, чтобы распространить инновационность технологии блокчейн во все индустрии, которые используют интернет для предоставления своих услуг. Банки ли это, или фондовые биржи, лотереи, голосование, музыка, аукционы и многие другие сферы, публичный цифровой реестр позволяет создавать децентрализованные автономные компании (т.н. DAC), которые предоставляют сервисы лучшего качества за меньшие деньги в сравнении с их более традиционными централизованными коллегами. Появление таких децентрализованных компаний возвещает о появлении в организационной структуре новой парадигмы, в которой компании могут работать без управления человеком и под контролем не подверженного коррупции набора правил ведения бизнеса. Эти правила закодированы в публично проверяемом программном обеспечении с открытым исходным кодом, распространенном на компьютерах держателей долей компании, которые без особых усилий защищают компанию от произвольного захвата контроля.</p>\\n<p>BitShares делает для бизнеса то, что Биткоин сделал для денег, используя технологию распределенного консенсуса для создания компаний, которые по своей сути глобальны, прозрачны, надежны, эффективны и, что не менее важно, прибыльны.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">Кошелек</h2>\\n<p>Этот кошелек обеспечивает доступ к большинству функций сети BitShares, включая</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/help/assets/mpa\\\">BitAssets (БитАктивы)</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/help/assets/uia\\\">Выпущенные пользователем активы</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\\\"/help/dex/introduction\\\">Биржу DEX</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n\";","module.exports = \"<h1 id=\\\"-\\\">Блокчейн</h1>\\n<p>Как и большинство криптовалют, для оповещения участников о транзакциях и происходящем на рынке протокол Графен использует технологию блокчейн. Так как блок всегда ссылается на предыдущий блок, мы получаем цепь блоков (блокчейн), которая содержит все когда-либо произведенные в сети транзакции. Так как блокчейн – это публично доступный и проверяемый реестр, любой желающий может детально просмотреть и проверить транзакции, а также рыночные ордера и биржевые стаканы.</p>\\n<p>Конечно, этот веб-кошелек предлагает Вам обозреватель блоков, дабы помочь Вам с аудитом.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">Механизм консенсуса</h2>\\n<p>То, кому именно и в какое время будет позволено <em>произвести</em> блок, определяется механизмом консенсуса под названием <em>Делегированное доказательство владения долей</em>. По сути, держатели долей BitShares (держатели токена BTS) могут голосовать за предпочитаемых ими производителей блоков в блокчейне. Этим так называемым <em>делегатам</em> с наибольшим количеством голосов и позволяется производить блоки.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">Транзакции</h2>\\n<p>Блокчейн-технология Графен предлагает Вам различные типы транзакций. Пользователи могут не только просто переводить активы друг другу, но и пользоваться транзакциями для взаимодействия с децентрализованной биржей. Большая часть этих типов транзакций помечена поясняющим флагом, другие же требуют некоторых познаний в механизмах внутреннего функционирования компании.</p>\\n\";","module.exports = \"<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">Сервисы моста и шлюза</h2>\\n<p>И мосты, и шлюзы позволяют Вам заводить и выводить монеты, однако существует разница в уровне доверия, которое Вам нужно будет оказать поставщикам этих сервисов.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"-\\\">Мосты: модель без доверия</h3>\\n<p>Сервис моста предоставляет Вам способ завести некоторое количество криптовалюты, помимо BitShares, и получить взамен эквивалент в SmartCoin. SmartCoins не подвержены посредническому риску, поэтому единственный риск, с которым Вы сталкиваетесь при использовании моста, это тот короткий момент времени, который нужен на завершение трансфера. Это лучше, чем централизованная биржа вроде Poloniex, на которой Вы всегда находитесь под риском взлома биржи, ее банкротства, или других подобных проблем.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"-\\\">Шлюзы: модель на основе доверия</h3>\\n<p>Шлюзы по сути являются аналогом стандартной модели биржи, где Вы зависите от платежеспособности биржи, которая должна выкупить Ваши монеты. В основном шлюзы выпускают активы с собственным символом в префиксе, например, TRADE или META. Эти активы на 100% обеспечены реальными BTC или ETH, либо же любой другой валютой, которую люди заводят через шлюзы.</p>\\n<p>Таким образом, OPEN.BTC теоретически эквивалентны BTC, которые Вы получаете на Poloniex, которые могут иметь префикс POLO.BTC. В обоих случаях Вы полагаетесь на поставщика сервиса: CCEDK для OPEN. assets и Poloniex для POLO. assets, которые должны оставаться платежеспособными, дабы обеспечивать ценность выпущенных ими активов. Так как шлюзы предоставляют только один сервис, который обычно является частью работы биржи, кто-нибудь даже может сказать, что их работа по обеспечению своих средств довольно легкая.</p>\\n\";","module.exports = \"<h1 id=\\\"-\\\">Комитет</h1>\\n<p>Комитет представляет собой утвержденный держателями долей набор единиц, который определяет некоторые параметры ведения дел. Среди этих параметров</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>комиссии за транзакции и торговлю</li>\\n<li>параметры блокчейна, такие как размер блока, интервал блока и т.п.</li>\\n<li>реферальные и вестинговые параметры, такие как процент кэшбэка и вестинговые периоды.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\";","module.exports = \"<h1 id=\\\"-\\\">Кошелек</h1>\\n<p>Как Вы уже могли заметить, это веб-приложение, которое работает в браузере. Соединение устанавливается с доверенным узлом сети, который служит шлюзом в остальную часть экосистемы.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">Облачный кошелек (Модель &quot;аккаунт&quot;)</h2>\\n<p>Если Вы зарегистрировались с использованием имени пользователя и пароля, Вы обладаете облачным кошельком. И хотя технически ничего не хранится в облаке, мы используем термин Облачный кошелек, потому что Вы можете использовать эти данные (имя пользователя и пароль) для получения доступа к своему аккаунту из любого веб-браузера в любой момент. Облачный кошелек позволяет получить доступ только к одному аккаунту за раз. Обычно это является оптимальным вариантом для новых пользователей. Несмотря на то, что автоматически сгенерированный пароль можно изменить, мы не рекомендуем делать это прямо сейчас. Наша команда работает над надежным способом смены пароля, который не потребует технических знаний. Мы объявим о его появлении, как только он будет готов.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">Локальный кошелек (Модель &quot;кошелек&quot;)</h2>\\n<p>Локальный кошелек создает базу данных в рамках Вашего браузера. Это означает, что доступ к Вашим средствам привязан <strong>только к этому браузеру</strong>. Если Вы попытаетесь получить доступ к своему локальному кошельку с любого другого компьютера или браузера, Вам это не удастся, если только Вы не проведете активный импорт файла резервной копии из файла резервной копии оригинального браузера. На самом деле этот процесс очень прост. Смотрите информацию об управлении <a href=\\\"/help/introduction/backups\\\">резервными копиями</a>.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">Безопасность</h2>\\n<p>Будьте уверены, что наши сервера никогда не получат доступа к Вашим средствам, потому как ни один из Ваших приватных ключей никогда не покидает браузер. Вместо этого они зашифрованы с помощью Вашей фразы-пароля и хранятся в локальной базе данных Вашего браузера. Поэтому Вам обязательно нужно иметь актуальную <a href=\\\"/help/introduction/backups\\\">резервную копию</a> на случай повреждения Вашего компьютера или браузера.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">Управление</h2>\\n<p>Пользовательский интерфейс способен содержать и предоставлять доступ к нескольким кошелькам, каждый из которых может содержать несколько аккаунтов и соответствующие им средства. Вы можете добавлять, создавать резервную копию и переключаться между существующими кошельками в меню <code>Настройки-&gt;Кошельки</code>.</p>\\n\";","module.exports = \"<h1 id=\\\"-\\\">Делегат</h1>\\n<p>Делегаты - это единицы, которые работают на блокчейн, создавая новые блоки. Каждый делегат утвержден держателями долей; он создает и подписывает блоки с действительными транзакциями. Каждая совершенная в сети транзакция должна в конечном итоге быть подтверждена всеми делегатами.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">Механизм консенсуса</h2>\\n<p>То, кому именно и в какое время будет позволено <em>произвести</em> блок, определяется механизмом консенсуса под названием <em>Делегированное доказательство владением долей</em>. По сути, держатели долей BitShares (держатели токена BTS) могут голосовать за предпочитаемых ими производителей блоков в блокчейне.

(N-of-M)模式，这个结构如下：</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>账户名</th>\\n<th>权重</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Alice</td>\\n<td>33%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Bob</td>\\n<td>33%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Charlie</td>\\n<td>33%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Dennis</td>\\n<td>33%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>----------</td>\\n<td>------</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>门槛阀值:</td>\\n<td>51%</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>这4个成员每人都有33%的权重，但是门槛阀值设定在50%。这样，至少需要2名成员同意才能获得多余门槛阀值的权重以签署有效交易。</p>\\n<p>同理，要构建 3-of-4 结构，我们可以降低每个成员的权重值到 17%，或者增加门槛阀值到 99%。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">(扁平结构) 灵活的多重签名</h2>\\n<p>通过门槛阀值和权重，现在我们管理资金时拥有了更多的灵活性，更准确的说，我们拥有了更多的<em>控制权</em>。比如，我们可以分配不同的权重到不同的成员。假设Alice希望通过多重签名机制来提高资金安全性防范偷窃，但又不想给与她的朋友们过多的控制权，那么，我们可以设定这样的职权实体分布：</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>账户名</th>\\n<th>权重</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Alice</td>\\n<td>49%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Bob</td>\\n<td>25%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Charlie</td>\\n<td>25%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Dennis</td>\\n<td>10%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>----------</td>\\n<td>------</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>门槛阀值:</td>\\n<td>51%</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>这样，Alice只需要任何一个朋友协助就能使用资金，或者其他3个朋友必须全部同意才能使用资金。</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"-\\\">多层次灵活的多重签名</h2>\\n<p>我们再来看一下一种简单的企业常用的多层级组织架构。这个公司有一个首席财务官，有多个部门向其汇报，如Treasurer, Controller, Tax Manager, \\nAccounting等。公司的首席执行官也要求拥有支付权。我们可以这样设计职权实体结构：</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>账户名</th>\\n<th>权重</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>CEO.COMPANY</td>\\n<td>51%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>CFO.COMPANY</td>\\n<td>51%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>------------</td>\\n<td>------</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>门槛阀值:</td>\\n<td>51%</td>\\n</tr>\\n</tbody>\\n</table>\\n<p>而 CEO.COMPANY 和 CFO.COMPANY 则拥有各自的职权实体。比如 CFO.COMPANY 账户可设置如下：</p>\\n<table>\\n<thead>\\n<tr>\\n<th>CFO.COMPANY</th>\\n<th>权重</th>\\n</tr>\\n</thead>\\n<tbody>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Chief.COMPANY</td>\\n<td>51%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Treasurer.COMPANY</td>\\n<td>33%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Controller.COMPANY</td>\\n<td>33%</td>\\n</tr>\\n<tr>\\n<td>Tax

DEX拥有的众多特性，用户可以根据自身需求来选择利用全部或者部分功能。</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>权力分离</strong>: \\n由同一个实体来发行资产（IOU）和处理订单是不合理，也是不必要的。在BitShares系统中，订单撮合是由网络协议执行，并不关心相关资产的内涵。</li>\\n<li><strong>全球整合的买卖盘</strong>:\\n全世界任何人只要能访问互联网就能访问BitShares，并使用DEX进行交易。这使得全球的流动性汇聚到同一个去中心化的买卖盘市场。</li>\\n<li><strong>交易几乎任何标的</strong>:\\nBitShares DEX可交易的资产是不受限的。你可以交易<strong>任何</strong>交易对。尽管有些交易对市场深度可能很低，比如白银:黄金（SILVER:GOLD），而有些交易对则会非常活跃，交易量很大，比如外汇交易美元:欧元（USD:EUR）。</li>\\n<li><strong>乐趣无限</strong>:\\nBitShares协议将无法限制你的交易体验。</li>\\n<li><strong>去中心化</strong>:\\nDEX在全球都是去中心化的。这不仅意味着不存在单点失败，而且BitShares交易所全年无休，7/24开放交易，因为任何时间，在世界上总有一个地方是白天交易时间。</li>\\n<li><strong>安全性</strong>:\\n你的资金和交易订单都由工业级别的椭圆曲线加密算法进行加密保护。没有人能够在未经你许可的情况下访问这些信息。我们还为用户提供了担保和多重签名机制进一步提高安全性。</li>\\n<li><strong>快捷</strong>:\\n与其他去中心化网络相比，BitShares DEX可以实现实时交易，速度仅受制于光速和地球的大小。</li>\\n<li><strong>可自证的订单撮合算法</strong>:\\n使BitShares DEX独一无二的是可自证的订单撮合算法。给定的一组交易订单，你总是可以验证这些订单是被正确的撮合，而不存在欺诈。</li>\\n<li><strong>抵押担保的智能资产（Smartcoins）</strong>:\\nBitShares一个最重要的特性是<em>智能资产（smartcoins）</em>，比如比特美元（bitUSD）、比特欧元（bitEUR）、比特人民币（bitCNY）等等。为了方便起见，系统中这些资产直接已美元（USD），欧元（EUR），人民币（CNY）表示。这些数字资产代表其对应物理货币的价值。钱包中的1比特美元等价于$1，可自由兑换。这些数字资产由BitShares公司股份（BTS）冻结抵押进行担保，并可按市价进行清算。</li>\\n</ul>\\n\";","module.exports
